Need to install the following on your machine:

Node JS enviroment: https://nodejs.org/en
	
	-Make sure you allow it to install all dependencies

MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

	-I installed the community version for windows
	-In the installer select 'full' setup type
	-Type and Networking: Select 'development computer' config
	-Type and Networking: Leave Connectivity settings as is (port:3306)
	-Authentication Method: Leave as strong
	-Accounts and Roles: I just set the root password to 'pass'
	-Windows Service: Leave as is
	-Server File Permissions: Leave as full access
	-Apply Configuration: Click execute
	-Don't change Router Configuration just click finish
	-Enter root password and click next

	Guide I followed for configuring MySQL (has steps for mac): 
	https://ladvien.com/data-analytics-mysql-localhost-setup/

	You can open MySQL Workbench, DB is named 'Local instance MySQL80'

MySQL driver for Node (run command in project directory): npm install mysql@latest

After compiling and running 'node dbDriver.js' should print "dbDriver: Connected to the database"
